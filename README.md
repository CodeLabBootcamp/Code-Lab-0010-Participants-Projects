# Code Lab

Code Lab is an intensive software development bootcamp focusing on writing software the right way, by following best practice and using right tools.
Code Lab’s mission is to empower young Iraqi developers to build performant, secure, scalable and maintainable software systems, so they can meet the demands of the Iraqi market both at a startup level and an enterprise level.
We have organized two bootcamps in the past, in November 2016, which was in Android applications development, and in August 2017, which was in Web development, focusing on both the frontend and backend sides.
We also have been doing free live streams on Facebook, in which we interactively taught the basics of many languages and platforms.

## Code Lab 0010 - Web Edition

Code Lab 0010 (2 in binary) is the second bootcamp we organize, we focused on web technologies this time around and targeted beginner-intermediate developers who have had some experience with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
We introduced the participants to Twitter’s Bootstrap CSS Framework, which contains pre-built CSS classes that make creating beautiful and responsive web pages much easier.
Afterwards, we started using VueJS, which is a frontend JavaScript framework for creating dynamic web pages while keeping your code clean and minimal. Finally, we moved to the backend side, and taught Laravel, which is a PHP framework which provides tools for developers to build feature-rich, secure, scalable and maintainable web apps and backend systems with ease and efficiency.
All while focusing on following best practice and use the right tools, developing on JetBrains’ amazing PhpStorm IDE (Integrated Development Environment), using Git with GitHub extensively throughout the training, and writing documentation and unit tests as we go.
